# spotify-to-youtube-music
A repository to develop my first api, that transfers a spotify playlist to an youtube music playlist :).  Doing my best to make a good gift to give to a very good friend. 

First steps according to chat gpt lmao:
   1- Setting up API keys: Make sure you have the necessary API keys to access the Spotify and YouTube Music APIs. These keys are essential for authenticating your requests and accessing the appropriate resources.

   2- Authentication: Familiarize yourself with the authentication process for the Spotify and YouTube Music APIs. Ensure that you understand the authentication requirements and how to obtain and use the necessary access tokens for your requests.

   3- Get Spotify playlist information: First, focus on making a request to the Spotify API to retrieve your friend's playlist information. This will include the title, artists, albums, and other relevant information of the songs in the playlist.

   4- Transfer to YouTube Music: Once you have the Spotify playlist information, you can start working on the transfer to YouTube Music. This will involve creating a new playlist on YouTube Music and adding the corresponding songs based on the information you obtained from Spotify.

   5- Handle edge cases: During the transfer of songs, be mindful of possible edge cases such as songs unavailable on YouTube Music or discrepancies in song identification information. Plan how to handle these cases to ensure the transfer is completed correctly.

   6- Test and debug: As you progress in developing the solution, test each step to ensure it is functioning as expected. Use Postman or other tools to test your requests and validate the results.

   7- Improvements and refinements: Once the basic transfer is working, you can consider additional improvements such as handling additional metadata of the songs, dealing with larger playlists, or implementing extra features like continuous synchronization between the two platforms.
